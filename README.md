This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a fake shopping website built with React and Redux as a way for me to practice using Redux. This is my first attempt at using Redux and an API. It uses an API to fetch 20 products which are all displayed on the main page. When you click on each product it will take you to a page with details about that particular product. The API I used is the Fake Store API : https://fakestoreapi.com/

I used Bootstrap to style the project.
